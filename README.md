# Online Quiz Project

In this project, we built a **_simple_** website where students can attend quizzes on various subjects. 

There will be an admin module where teachers can create, read, update, and delete questions. Also, they will be able to create, read, update, and delete subjects. There can be multiple exams under one subject. Teachers can also see the information about examinees.

Students will be able to see the subjects, questions, and individual scores. They will also see how many questions they have answered correctly. 
Both admin and student modules will be password protected. 
New students must register by filling up the necessary information to create an account.
